# [Level of Nodes](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/level-of-nodes-1587115620/1)

Level: Medium

## Description

Given an integer x and an undirected acyclic graph with v nodes, labeled from 0 to v-1, and e edges, return the level of node labeled as x.

Level is the minimum number of edges you must travel from the node 0 to some target.

If there doesn't exists such a node that is labeled as x, return -1.

## Example 1

Input: x = 4
Output: 2

## Example 2

Input: x = 1
Output: 1
